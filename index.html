            <h2>Current issue</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest problems in today's real 
                estate market is that many systems are outdated. 
                People often have to physically visit offices or 
                companies to ask about houses or apartments, which 
                takes a lot of time and effort. This traditional 
                process can be inconvenient, especially for those 
                with busy schedules or those searching for properties 
                in different locations.

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
